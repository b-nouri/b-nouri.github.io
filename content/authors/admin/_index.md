The passion for programming and designing new software tools made me change my field and follow a masters in IT. Since then, I have been inovelved in numerious IT projects as business analyst, lead product manager, project manager and data scientist.



Having **more than 7 years** of industry experience, I have learned a lot about data modelling and database design, Sofware project management, data warehousing, BI and reporting systems.

My first interaction with data science and it's toolset roots back in **2013** when I used **R Language** for discovering the trend of AI reserach employing text mining algorithms.

As I have always been a passionate learner, I decided to dive deeper in machine learning and AI and started a new program in data science in 2019. Since that time I have done various projects in statistical modelling, machine learning and big data analytics.

In my current day to day job at CLdN I use **python**, **SQL** and **Power BI** a lot. Ocasionally, based on the nature of the project I may decide to employ **R**.
